Stage 0
Hello teachers we are going to excel in this project
Bonjour!

Stage 1
1.	Creating data contracts for the data layer (Data Entities DO).
2.	Creating a service contract using interfaces (DalApi) for accessing entities (each entity has its own interface).
3.	Storing data in object lists in memory.
4.	Implementing data access methods for the lists (CRUD).
5.	Exceptions.
6.	User Interface (Console) - Data layer testing program.
7.	Creating an initial database.
Bonus : Implementing password for each volunteer.

Stage 2 
1. Create a unified service contract for the data layer using a generic interface and inherit from it.
2. Update interfaces to use general data collections (<>IEnumerable).
3. Update all layers to process data using LINQ only (without loops).
4. Add exceptions.
