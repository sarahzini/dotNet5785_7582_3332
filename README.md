Stage 0
Hello teachers we are going to excel in this project
Bonjour!

Stage 1
1.	Creating data contracts for the data layer (Data Entities DO).
2.	Creating a service contract using interfaces (DalApi) for accessing entities (each entity has its own interface).
3.	Storing data in object lists in memory.
4.	Implementing data access methods for the lists (CRUD).
5.	Exceptions.
6.	User Interface (Console) - Data layer testing program.
7.	Creating an initial database.
Bonus : Implementing Password for each volunteer.

Stage 2 
1. Create a unified service contract for the data layer using a generic interface and inherit from it.
2. Update interfaces to use general data collections (<>IEnumerable).
3. Update all layers to process data using LINQ only (without loops).
4. Add exceptions.

Stage 3
Implement an additional data layer using XML files for data storage.

Stage 4
1.Completion of the Layered Model:
- Finalizing the layered architecture.
2.Design Patterns:
- Implementing the Singleton and Simple Factory Method design patterns.
- Including their use in the data layers.
3.Logical Layer Data Contract:
-Creating logical entities (BO - Business Objects) for the logical layer.
4.Service Contract:
- Creating a generic interface (BlApi) to define the service contract for the logical layer.
5.User Interface (Console):
- Developing a test program for the logical layer using a console-based interface to validate its functionality.

Stage 5
-Start building the graphical user interface (GUI).
-Develop a basic, functional GUI that allows the user to interact with your data and services.
-Consider using XAML for defining the UI, and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for maintaining clean separation between logic and presentation.

Stage 6
-Build a fully functional and polished graphical interface.
-Complete your GUI with all required functionalities like buttons, textboxes, and data-binding.
-Make sure updates to the display are handled through binding, ensuring that all updates come directly from the XAML without manual intervention in the code.

Stage 7 
-Work with multi-threading and integrate a simulator.
-Add threading to simulate background tasks, improving performance or mimicking real-world usage.
-Create a separate Visual Studio project for the simulator, allowing it to run in parallel with the GUI.
-Use the simulator to provide realistic test data to the GUI or trigger simulated events.
